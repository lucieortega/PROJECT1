            The Luci√®rnaga collection founded and designed by Lucie Ortega is inspired by Central
             America's beautiful and exotic lifestyle, adding a French-European touch. 
             The French fashion designer; Lucie graduated in 2015 from a Parisian fashion school as a Stylist designer Textile. 
             She is passionate about textures, patterns, interior design, loves to travel, and the Latino culture finds her inspiration in creating patterns.
              <br>Early this year, we found
        ourselves afforded the time to work on something that had always been our goal: Create
        our Fashion brand. Creating unique prints and working with Salvadorean artisans are our top
        priority: We valorize handmade and artisanal work. The majority of our patterns use watercolor techniques.
        We hope you will enjoy our Brand as much as we enjoy making it. This is truly a dream that 
        comes true for us, and we are so happy to be sharing it with you! <br>
        Lots of Love, Lucie
        </p>
